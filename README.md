Yaru-Blue is a fork of Ubuntu's Yaru theme, featured in Ubuntu 18.10.

This is my first release on git and also my first GTK and Gnome-Shell theme.
Yaru-Blue contains following:
- GTK 2 theme
- GTK 3 theme
- Gnome-Shell theme
- Icon pack

All of them are based on original Yaru, I just changed all orange and purple colors to blue.
The icon pack got only recolored places and status icons (folders).

Installation:
- clone this git into a directory of your choice
- run the install.sh as root (root is needed for copying all files)
- follow the installer

It's made for Ubuntu 18.10, espacially the Gnome-Shell theme. 
Please notify me if you find some issues or if you have any ideas for the future.

Remove Yaru-Blue:
- run the uninstall.sh as root
